  {user_id: 2, title: "The dark side of the universe – a primer", body: "Over the past 40 years astronomers have realised that everything we can see – all the stars, planets and galaxies – make up less than 5% of the entire universe. What is the rest? The short answer is, we have no idea.\nWhat we do know is there are two gaping holes in our understanding of our universe. As a placeholder, physicists call them dark matter and dark energy.\n\nIn a nutshell, dark matter is the invisible stuff which we can only detect from the way its immense gravity moves stars and galaxies.\n\nDark energy, on the other hand, is the mysterious something causing the universe to expand with ever increasing speed.\n\nWe don’t know if dark matter and dark energy are related – in fact they’re probably two completely different phenomena, both called “dark” just because we can’t see them.\n\nDark matter\nHow was it discovered?\n\nSince the 1930s astronomers knew that the way galaxies spin did not make sense. The stars at the edges of galaxies were moving much faster than expected – so fast they should have been flung off the cosmic merry-go-round and out into deep space.\n\nBut these strange motions could be explained if there was a bunch of extra matter in and around the galaxies – matter that we can’t see. It’s this “dark matter” that holds galaxies together.\n\nSince then, many other observations beyond the scale of whirling galaxies, from the choreography of galaxy clusters, to the collision of nebulae, all suggested the same thing.\n\nAlthough some physicists have entertained other theories, such as modifications to gravity, by now most are pretty sure dark matter exists. It’s the only explanation that suits all the data.\n\nWhat do we know?\n\nWe know dark matter doesn’t emit light (nor does it absorb or reflect it), so it can’t be made of rogue planets or clouds of normal matter. We know it’s “cold” (which in physics-speak means it moves slowly compared with the speed of light). We know it has gravity. We also know it doesn’t interact very strongly with anything, even itself – otherwise the dark matter would collapse into flat structures such as galaxies, rather than the spherical haloes we detect.\n\nOh, and it makes up about 27% of the universe.\n\nWhat could dark matter be?\n\nThe bottom line is it is probably some new kind of particle (or a whole family of particles) that we have never detected before. Dark matter particles could be all around you, and floating through your body right this second.\n\nThis means the answer to this grand cosmological puzzle, affecting the universe on scales of mllions of light years, could lie in the physics of tiny particles, much smaller than an atom.\n\nOver the past 30 years physicists have sifted through dozens of different dark matter candidates. The prime suspect at the moment is a kind of particle called a weakly interacting massive particle, or WIMP. This is a kind of heavy particles that feel only the weak force.\n\nOne of the goals of CERN’s Large Hadron Collider is to look for WIMPs (the same way it found the Higgs Boson in 2013) – the elusive dark matter particles might be created when protons are smashed together at near the speed of light.\n\nCan we detect dark matter?\n\nBesides CERN, there are more than 30 experiments around the world devoted to finding dark matter.\n\nSome of these are dedicated telescopes searching for the signature of particles created when two particles of dark matter annihilate.\n\nOthers are giant vats of liquid xenon watching for a telltale flash when a dark matter particle nudges an atomic nucleus. None has yet made a convincing detection of a dark matter particle, although some of the experiments have ruled out various possibilities of what dark matter might be.\n\nIt remains a possibility that dark matter may never be directly detectable – especially if it turns out to be a particle that does not even feel the weak force.\n\nThe dark force and dark photons\n\nSome physicists have proposed that dark matter particles can interact with one another via a new force of nature – called, yes, the dark force and transmitted by dark photons (aka dark radiation).\n\nThere may even be different kinds of dark matter, some of which feels the dark force, and some do not.\n\nDark energy\nHow was dark energy discovered?\n\nIn the early 20th century, physicists including Albert Einstein imagined the universe as static and unchanging. But in 1929 American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed the motions of exploding stars and discovered the universe was expanding. In fact the universe must have had a beginning – a moment of creation called the big bang.\n\nWe can imagine the big bang a bit like an explosion. But after that initial burst, physicists thought the expansion should begin to slow down over time, as gravity acted to pull everything back to a single point again.\n\nThe question was whether the universe would ever stop expanding and reverse direction, falling back into a “big crunch”.\n\nThen, in 1998, things got a bit more complicated.\n\nUsing the same method as Edwin Hubble (and with the telescope named after him) astronomers found that the expansion of the universe was not slowing down, but instead was accelerating. Galaxies are flying away from each other faster and faster each year.\n\nIt was a strange and unexpected result. A bit like if you were driving on a flat highway, took your foot off the accelerator – and then your car began to speed up!\n\nYet the data were convincing. Physicists realised this expansion must be driven by some sort of energy, and they called it “dark energy”.\n\nWhat we know\n\nWe know that dark energy affects the universe as a whole. We know it acts a bit like a negative gravity pushing galaxies away from one another.\n\nWe also know that dark energy did not kick in until a few billion years ago. (For the first half of its life, the expansion of the universe was slowing down due to gravity pulling everything together.)\n\nThis makes physicists think dark energy is somehow tied up with space itself. This means its density in space is always the same, but as the universe expands (that is as more space is created), the amount of dark energy also increases.\n\nThis would explain why the amount of dark energy was insignificant when the universe was small.\n\nWhat could it be?\n\nThe answer to the mystery of dark energy might also lie in the minuscule quantum realm.\n\nIn quantum theory, “empty space” is not empty at all, but filled with a soup of particles continually popping into and out of existence. As weird as it sounds, physicists have actually measured the force created by these so-called “virtual particles” in the lab.\n\nThe problem is, when physicists try to calculate how much energy these virtual particles contribute to each cubic metre of empty space, they come out with a number that’s a factor of 10120 too large when compared to the density of dark energy (as measured from the accelerated expansion of the universe). Thats a 1 with 120 zeroes after it, a ludicrous answer called “the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics”.\n\nQuintessence\n\nSome physicists think dark energy could be akin to a fifth force of nature, pervading all of space. They call it “quintessence”, after the fifth element predicted by the Greek philosophers. As opposed to the cosmological constant, the quintessence is imagined to change over time – it was once attractive, but is now repulsive.\n\nThe big rip and phantom dark energy\n\nIn some theories, the quintessence can continue to grow stronger (in which case it’s called phantom dark energy).\n\nThis could destroy the universe.\n\nIf the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate, eventually reach the speed of light – first galaxies and stars would be cut off from one another, then eventually the space between the sun and the Earth would expand faster than the speed of light and individual atoms would be torn asunder as the space within them expanded at faster than the speed of light. This is the big rip.\n\nA new gravity?\n\nDark energy might not be a new force, it might just be a sign that, at very large scales, gravity does not behave as Einstein’s theory of general relatively describes.\n\nThe ΛCDM (lambda cold dark matter) model\nThis is the name for the astrophysicists’ current best picture of the way the cosmos is screwed together.\n\nΛ (or lambda) stands for dark energy, while cold dark matter describes the consensus that dark matter must be made up of some kind of slow moving, previously unknown particle.\n\nIn this picture, dark matter makes up 27% of the mass-energy of the universe, dark energy makes up about 68%, and ordinary matter – that of the stars and galaxies and our own flesh and blood – makes up less than 5%.", source: "https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/the-dark-side-of-the-universe-a-primer", picture_url: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dzpkgj9f0/image/upload/v1467754870/xah6bg3jevj4hy2edb7n.jpg"},
  {user_id: 1, title: "Ocular perfusion pressure and ocular blood flow in glaucoma", body: "Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy of unknown origin. It has been hypothesized that a vascular component is involved in glaucoma pathophysiology. This hypothesis has gained support from studies showing that reduced ocular perfusion pressure is a risk factor for the disease. The exact nature of the involvement is, however, still a matter of debate. Based on recent evidence we propose a model including primary and secondary insults in glaucoma. The primary insult appears to happen at the optic nerve head. Increased intraocular pressure and ischemia at the post-laminar optic nerve head affects retinal ganglion cell axons. Modulating factors are the biomechanical properties of the tissues and cerebrospinal fluid pressure. After this primary insult retinal ganglion cells function at a reduced energy level and are sensitive to secondary insults. These secondary insults may happen if ocular perfusion pressure falls below the lower limit of autoregulation or if neurovascular coupling fails. Evidence for both faulty autoregulation and reduced hyperemic response to neuronal stimulation has been provided in glaucoma patients. The mechanisms appear to involve vascular endothelial dysfunction and impaired astrocyte-vessel signaling. A more detailed understanding of these pathways is required to direct neuroprotective strategies via the neurovascular pathway.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGlaucoma is a family of multifactorial optical neuropathies characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) leading to typical optic nerve head (ONH) damage and distinctive visual field defects. Although the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown, it is well established that the main risk factor for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Reducing IOP is effective in slowing down the progression of the disease but some patients still progress despite adequately controlled IOP.\n\nSeveral studies implicated vascular risk factors in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, blood pressure (BP) and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) being the most studied. This vascular hypothesis is based on the premise that abnormal perfusion and the subsequent ischemia of the ONH play a major role in the glaucomatous damage. The OPP is the difference between arterial and venous BP. In the eye the venous pressure almost equals IOP. As such the OPP can be estimated as the difference between the arterial pressure and IOP. The relationship between BP and glaucoma is complex and controversial. On the one hand some studies indicate that systemic hypertension is a risk factor for glaucoma [1, 2 and 3]. On the other hand some studies indicate that low systemic BP is a risk factor for development and progression of glaucoma. A direct and clear relationship between BP level and glaucomatous damage has, however, not been established [4]. The good irrigation of the ocular tissues is ensured by an adequate OPP depending on a complex regulation process that balances BP and the IOP. As such dealing with the concept of OPP and BP at the same time is more pertinent.\n\nLarge epidemiological studies have shown that low OPP is a risk factor for the prevalence, incidence and progression of glaucoma. In the Barbados Eye Study [5] low systolic BP doubled the risk for glaucoma incidence. Subjects with the lowest 20% of diastolic perfusion pressure were 3.3 times more likely to develop glaucoma. In the Proyecto VER Study [6] it was established that patients with a diastolic perfusion pressure as low as 45 mmHg had a three times greater risk of developing glaucoma compared to those with a diastolic perfusion pressure of 65 mmHg. This is in keeping with data from the Egna–Neumarkt Study [1] showing that the prevalence of the disease in patients with diastolic perfusion pressure less than 50 mmHg increases 4.5 fold compared to patients with diastolic perfusion pressure of 65 mmHg.\n\nData on glaucoma progression are available from The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT). Patients with low systolic perfusion pressure at baseline progressed faster than their counterparts. Low systolic perfusion pressure was a predictor of progression with an almost 50% higher risk [7]. More in depth reviews on the data linking OPP to glaucoma prevalence, incidence and progression have been provided [4, 8 and 9•]. This review, however, will formulate some hypotheses as to why OPP is a risk factor.\n\nWhy is low OPP a risk factor for glaucoma?\n\nVascular factors have been identified in many chronic neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [10••]. In glaucoma the hypothesis of a vascular involvement in the disease process has been formulated a long time ago. The evidence that low OPP is a risk factor for the disease has further supported this concept. Calculation of OPP as presented above is only an estimate of the true OPP. Indeed it assumes that mean arterial pressure (MAP) as measured at the brachial artery is a good measure of MAP at the level of the ophthalmic artery. To which degree this assumption is fulfilled, however, is not clear. In addition, IOP does not equal venous pressure in the eye. Obviously IOP is always slightly lower than pressure in retinal or choroidal veins [11 and 12]. In addition, there is evidence that the difference between venous pressure and IOP is increased in patients with glaucoma. This is related to the phenomenon of spontaneous venous pulsations in the central retinal vein, which appear to be a risk factor for glaucoma [13]. Hence our current way of estimating OPP involves both systematic and statistical errors. As such it is likely that the relationship between true OPP and glaucomatous damage is much stronger than indicated above.\n\nWhilst it is well-established that reduced OPP (as currently estimated) is a risk factor for glaucoma there is considerable controversy as to why this is the case. In the following we present a theory describing pathways that may depend on OPP and contribute to glaucomatous damage. As indicated in Figure 1 we assume that loss of RGCs is the consequence of primary and secondary insults as suggested previously [14•]. The site of primary insult to RGC axons in glaucoma is most likely within the ONH, more specifically at the lamina cribrosa. Increased IOP may be responsible for this loss of RGC axons modulated by the biomechanical properties of the ocular tissues [15, 16 and 17••] and the level of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSF) [18, 19 and 20]. As such, low CSF pressure may be one of the factors by which OPP modulates the risk of glaucoma because changes in either of them lead to a change in the trans-lamina cribrosa pressure gradient.\n\nAnother factor in the primary glaucomatous insult that may be enhanced by low OPP is ONH ischemia associated with reduced flow of nutrients to the RGC axons. Some investigators assume that this ischemia at the ONH is primary and at least in some cases associated with systemic disease [21]. Another possibility is that IOP-related strain within the peri-papillary sclera affects perfusion through the scleral branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries [17••]. The vasculature of the ONH is complex and the post-laminar regions of the ONH are supplied by branches of the posterior ciliary arteries [22]. Owing to its deep anatomical location little is known about blood flow (BF) and its regulation in this part of the ONH. Most quantitative data about ONH BF regulation stem from the anterior ONH regions that are supplied by the central retinal artery [23•].\n\nOnce a primary insult has occurred at the level of the ONH RGCs appear to function at reduced energy levels with affected mitochondria. This is supported by numerous experimental data [14• and 24] including electrophysiological studies in the primate revealing that affected RGCs retain some of their functionality [25]. As such neuroprotective strategies may be implemented to rescue injured RGCs independently of the primary insult. Indeed targeting mitochondria may offer a wide range of strategies for RGC survival including the dynamic processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, the electron transport chain components, ion channels and defense strategies against oxidative stress.\n\nOxidative stress associated with extensive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as free radicals, hydrogen peroxide, or singlet oxygen is another factor that may be enhanced by ischemia associated with low OPP. Free radicals are molecules containing unpaired electrons in their outer orbits. Singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide do not have unpaired electrons but are unstable and in a reactive state. ROS are constantly produced in cells. Oxidative stress occurs when the balance between production of ROS and endogenous antioxidative defense systems is disturbed either owing to increased ROS activity or owing to reduced antioxidative capacity. Ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion are classic triggers for ROS generation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress offers a potential target for neuroprotection in glaucoma. Strategies may be wide and include inhibition of ROS formation, administration and/or supplementation with antioxidants or with agents that increase the reducing power necessary for ROS detoxification or stimulation of gene expression for increasing mitochondrial antioxidant defenses [26].\n\nAnother pathway in which reduced OPP may contribute is related to secondary insults associated with abnormal autoregulation or a breakdown in neurovascular coupling. Here it is assumed that RGCs that function at low energy states are susceptible to periods of ischemia or reduced nutritional support. Such periods can happen if OPP falls below the lower autoregulatory limit or if the functional hyperemic reaction to visual stimulation is dysfunctional in patients with glaucoma. These two possibilities are discussed in the next sections.\n\nAutoregulation\n\nAutoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain its BF despite changes in perfusion pressure. We have recently provided an in-depth review on the relation between OPP and ocular BF [27••] and as such only some of the aspects that are relevant for the present topic will be covered. Nowadays there is evidence that retinal, ONH and choroidal BF show some regulatory capacity in response to changes in OPP [22, 27•• and 28]. Traditionally it is assumed that at the lower limit of autoregulation vessels are fully dilated. This is, however, not the case because the hyperemic vasodilator response to flicker stimulation is fully preserved even below the lower limit of autoregulation [29].\n\nThe mechanisms of autoregulation are complex and not fully understood. In the retina and the ONH it appears that autoregulation is strongly dependent on myogenic and metabolic mechanisms. In the choroid the rich parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory innervation as well as intrinsic choroidal neurons plays a key role in BF regulation in face of changes in OPP [22].\n\nIn glaucoma abnormal autoregulation of ocular BF was observed in a large variety of studies. This includes experiments in which IOP was modified and studies in which the response to posture changes was assessed [27••]. Evidence for altered autoregulatory capacity in glaucoma also arises from group correlations between ocular BF and OPP [30, 31 and 32].\n\nThe reason for abnormal autoregulation in glaucoma patients is not fully understood (Figure 2). Obviously reduced OPP as well as increased OPP variability may lead to a fall of BF when the lower limit of autoregulation is reached [27••]. Increased variability of OPP and nocturnal BP dipping have indeed been identified as risk factors for glaucoma [33, 34 and 35••].\n\nEvidence has accumulated that, at least in the choroid, BF regulates better when MAP is modified than when IOP is modulated. This means that at the same level of OPP BF may also depend on the absolute value of MAP and IOP. This phenomenon has already been described in the landmark paper by Kiel and Shepherd. The authors have developed a rabbit model in which MAP can be modulated by placing an occluder around the thoracic vena cava. This allows for measurement of choroidal BF while OPP is modified although IOP is held constant. Interestingly BF regulated better when IOP was kept constant at levels of 5 mmHg than at levels of 25 mmHg [36]. In recent years we have performed several studies indicating that this is also the case in humans [37•, 38 and 39]. As such any reduction in IOP is associated with an improvement in BF regulation.\n\nAlterations in autoregulation in glaucoma may also arise from a phenomenon called primary vascular dysregulation. This term was introduced by Flammer describing otherwise healthy subjects that show abnormal regulation in response to temperature changes and mechanical or emotional stress [40]. The basis for this dysregulation is not clear, but may be related to vascular endothelial dysfunction. Several observations indicate that endothelial dysfunction is associated with glaucoma [41 and 42•]. In addition, both endothelin and nitric oxide (NO) are key regulators of ONH and choroidal BF at baseline and during isometric exercise [43 and 44].\n\nIn the ONH there is evidence that glial cells play a role in autoregulatory processes. This may be related to loss of autoregulation in glaucoma, because astrocytes are considered to play a key role in tissue remodeling of the ONH [45]. It is, however, unclear how early this activation of astrocytes occurs although there is evidence that release of substances such as glutamate and tumor necrosis factor α from astrocytes is involved in RGC death [14•]. In the ONH astrocytes are involved in autoregulation during an increase in IOP, because the gliotoxic agent L-2-aminoadipic acid modifies the BF response during the decrease in OPP [46••].\n\nNeurovascular coupling\n\nIn the brain and the retina BF increases when neurons get active, a response called functional hyperemia [47••]. This phenomenon called neurovascular coupling has attracted much interest because an abnormal BF response to neuronal stimulation causes cell death caused by inadequate nutrient supply. Our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie neurovascular coupling has increased significantly in the recent years. Astrocytes play a key role in mediating the vasodilator response associated with neural activity. Briefly, synaptically released glutamate activates N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors in neurons and astrocytes, respectively [47••]. This leads to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ activating arachidonic acid pathways associated with the synthesis of vasodilators such as prostaglandins and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and vasoconstrictors such as 20-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid.\n\nIn addition NO synthesized from NO synthase-1 in neurons may play a role in the vasodilator response. Indeed, NO synthase inhibition blunts the retinal hyperemic response to flicker stimulation in humans [48]. Generally it is, however, believed that NO has a modulatory rather than a mediating role in the human retinal neurovascular coupling, because the activity of the enzymes in the arachidonic acid pathways depend on the level of NO [49•]. As such the hyperemic response may also depend on endothelial NO related to flow-mediated mechanisms [50].\n\nIn glaucoma the response of retinal and ONH BF to flicker stimulation is reduced [51, 52 and 53]. Factors contributing to the reduced hyperemic response in glaucoma are presented in Figure 3. Primary vascular dysregulation appears to be associated with abnormal retinal neurovascular coupling, because vasospastic subjects show a reduced response to flicker stimulation [54]. In keeping with this idea endothelial dysfunction may be also related to the altered responses seen in glaucoma [42•]. The level of IOP, however, does not appear to be directly related to the reduced hyperemic response, because short-term elevation does not influence flicker-induced vasodilatation [29]. Activated astrocytes in glaucoma are also potential sources of impaired vasodilator response to flicker stimulation, although this hypothesis remains unproven. Independently of the mechanisms contributing to reduced flicker responses in glaucoma it may well be that abnormal neurovascular coupling plays a role in the secondary insults to RGCs as shown in Figure 1.\n\nConclusions and future directions\n\nOne of the reasons why our understanding of the relation between OPP and glaucoma is still limited lies in the difficulties to measure retinal and ONH BF [55, 56, 57 and 58]. Doppler optical coherence tomography may become a technique capable of measuring BF in a valid and reproducible way [59, 60, 61 and 62•]. This improvement in technology is associated with the hope of gaining more insight into ocular BF regulation.\n\nIs it feasible to increase OPP as part of glaucoma treatment? Most probably this is not the case. On the one hand it is pharmacologically difficult to increase OPP. On the other hand one needs to be careful not to induce systemic hypertension with such approaches. An exception may be reducing anti-hypertensive treatment in patients with systemic hypertension in order to prevent very low OPPs [63]. When neuroprotective strategies are implemented it appears that it is not enough to focus on the pathways that are involved in programmed cell death of RGCs (Figure 4). Most probably neurovascular as well as neuroinflammatory pathways (not described in this review) need to be targeted as well [10••]. Generally the pathways leading to primary and secondary insults in glaucoma need to be better described to target the neurovascular component in glaucoma.\n\n\n\n", source: "", picture_url: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dzpkgj9f0/image/upload/v1467753550/k1iknu7doaqgmwip9vtq.jpg"},
  {user_id: 1, title: "Hallucinatory 'voices' shaped by local culture, Stanford anthropologist says", body: "People suffering from schizophrenia may hear “voices” – auditory hallucinations – differently depending on their cultural context, according to new Stanford research.\n\nIn the United States, the voices are harsher, and in Africa and India, more benign, said Tanya Luhrmann, a Stanford professor of anthropology and first author of the article in the British Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nThe experience of hearing voices is complex and varies from person to person, according to Luhrmann. The new research suggests that the voice-hearing experiences are influenced by one’s particular social and cultural environment – and this may have consequences for treatment.\n\nIn an interview, Luhrmann said that American clinicians “sometimes treat the voices heard by people with psychosis as if they are the uninteresting neurological byproducts of disease which should be ignored. Our work found that people with serious psychotic disorder in different cultures have different voice-hearing experiences. That suggests that the way people pay attention to their voices alters what they hear their voices say. That may have clinical implications.”\n\nPositive and negative voices\nLuhrmann said the role of culture in understanding psychiatric illnesses in depth has been overlooked.\n\n“The work by anthropologists who work on psychiatric illness teaches us that these illnesses shift in small but important ways in different social worlds. Psychiatric scientists tend not to look at cultural variation. Someone should, because it’s important, and it can teach us something about psychiatric illness,” said Luhrmann, an anthropologist trained in psychology. She is the Watkins University Professor at Stanford.\n\nFor the research, Luhrmann and her colleagues interviewed 60 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia – 20 each in San Mateo, California; Accra, Ghana; and Chennai, India. Overall, there were 31 women and 29 men with an average age of 34. They were asked how many voices they heard, how often, what they thought caused the auditory hallucinations, and what their voices were like.\n\n“We then asked the participants whether they knew who was speaking, whether they had conversations with the voices, and what the voices said. We asked people what they found most distressing about the voices, whether they had any positive experiences of voices and whether the voice spoke about sex or God,” she said.\n\nThe findings revealed that hearing voices was broadly similar across all three cultures, according to Luhrmann. Many of those interviewed reported both good and bad voices, and conversations with those voices, as well as whispering and hissing that they could not quite place physically. Some spoke of hearing from God while others said they felt like their voices were an “assault” upon them.\n\n‘Voices as bombardment’\nThe striking difference was that while many of the African and Indian subjects registered predominantly positive experiences with their voices, not one American did. Rather, the U.S. subjects were more likely to report experiences as violent and hateful – and evidence of a sick condition.\n\nThe Americans experienced voices as bombardment and as symptoms of a brain disease caused by genes or trauma.\n\nOne participant described the voices as “like torturing people, to take their eye out with a fork, or cut someone’s head and drink their blood, really nasty stuff.” Other Americans (five of them) even spoke of their voices as a call to battle or war – “the warfare of everyone just yelling.”\n\nMoreover, the Americans mostly did not report that they knew who spoke to them and they seemed to have\u2028less personal relationships with their voices, according to Luhrmann.\n\nAmong the Indians in Chennai, more than half (11) heard voices of kin or family members commanding them to do tasks. “They talk as if elder people advising younger people,” one subject said. That contrasts to the Americans, only two of whom heard family members. Also, the Indians heard fewer threatening voices than the Americans – several heard the voices as playful, as manifesting spirits or magic, and even as entertaining. Finally, not as many of them described the voices in terms of a medical or psychiatric problem, as all of the Americans did.\n\nIn Accra, Ghana, where the culture accepts that disembodied spirits can talk, few subjects described voices in brain disease terms. When people talked about their voices, 10 of them called the experience predominantly positive; 16 of them reported hearing God audibly. “Mostly, the voices are good,” one participant remarked.\n\nIndividual self vs. the collective\nWhy the difference? Luhrmann offered an explanation: Europeans and Americans tend to see themselves as individuals motivated by a sense of self identity, whereas outside the West, people imagine the mind and self interwoven with others and defined through relationships.\n\n“Actual people do not always follow social norms,” the scholars noted. “Nonetheless, the more independent emphasis of what we typically call the ‘West’ and the more interdependent emphasis of other societies has been demonstrated ethnographically and experimentally in many places.”\n\nAs a result, hearing voices in a specific context may differ significantly for the person involved, they wrote. In America, the voices were an intrusion and a threat to one’s private world – the voices could not be controlled.\n\nHowever, in India and Africa, the subjects were not as troubled by the voices – they seemed on one level to make sense in a more relational world. Still, differences existed between the participants in India and Africa; the former’s voice-hearing experience emphasized playfulness and sex, whereas the latter more often involved the voice of God.\n\nThe religiosity or urban nature of the culture did not seem to be a factor in how the voices were viewed, Luhrmann said.\n\n“Instead, the difference seems to be that the Chennai (India) and Accra (Ghana) participants were more comfortable interpreting their voices as relationships and not as the sign of a violated mind,” the researchers wrote.\n\nRelationship with voices\nThe research, Luhrmann observed, suggests that the “harsh, violent voices so common in the West may not be an inevitable feature of schizophrenia.” Cultural shaping of schizophrenia behavior may be even more profound than previously thought.\n\nThe findings may be clinically significant, according to the researchers. Prior research showed that specific therapies may alter what patients hear their voices say. One new approach claims it is possible to improve individuals’ relationships with their voices by teaching them to name their voices and to build relationships with them, and that doing so diminishes their caustic qualities. “More benign voices may contribute to more benign course and outcome,” they wrote.\n\nCo-authors for the article included R. Padmavati and Hema Tharoor from the Schizophrenia Research Foundation in Chennai, India, and Akwasi Osei from the Accra General Psychiatric Hospital in Accra, Ghana.\n\nWhat’s next in line for Luhrmann and her colleagues?\n\n“Our hunch is that the way people think about thinking changes the way they pay attention to the unusual experiences associated with sleep and awareness, and that as a result, people will have different spiritual experiences, as well as different patterns of psychiatric experience,” she said, noting a plan to conduct a larger, systematic comparison of spiritual, psychiatric and thought process experiences in five countries.", source: "http://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/", picture_url: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dzpkgj9f0/image/upload/v1467761030/fb4dgmwyq2qwgtedwoco.jpg"},
  {user_id: 1, title: "The Roland TR-808: the drum machine that revolutionised music", body: "The congas ring cheekily, the cowbell plays a corroded chime, the snare is parched and cruel – and the bass drum, a hard bloom of air, is barely music at all. With these core sounds, abetted by a handful of others, a simple drum machine gave house, techno and hip-hop the language it still speaks today.\n\nThe Roland TR-808 went out of production in 1983, even as the music that depended on it was being formed. Now Roland has resurrected it as the TR-8. The new model features all the sounds of the original as well as those of its successor, the TR-909 (there is also a relaunched version of the TB-303, the imitation bass guitar that acid house producers used to produce disturbing, squelching undulations). The 909 certainly left its mark, its hi-hats becoming one of the hallmarks of techno's froideur, but it's the 808 that remains the most iconic and influential.\n\nUntil the 808 became available in 1980, drum machines were something you put on top of a living-room organ to play along in time with. \"Suddenly there was a move to make rhythm machines that could be used in the professional market, to break away from this preset bossa nova thing,\" says Sean Montgomery, a product manager at Roland. Roland aimed to recreate actual drum sounds, but the 808's drum sounds, created by running an electrical current through transistors, sounded very little like the real thing. \"They did it the best they could with the analogue technology, and it sounded shit,\" says Montgomery with admirable frankness. The 808 went into commercial freefall.\n\nBut with units at low prices, relatively cash-strapped producers picked them up, and here the legend begins. Detroit techno producer Juan Atkins bought \"the first 808 in Michigan\" when he was still in high school, using it for his band Cybotron. \"I had a class called Future Studies, about the transition from an industrial society to a technological society,\" he says. \"I just applied a lot of those principles to my music-making.\" The 808 was the perfect tool for his future music, a \"hi-tech funk\" inspired equally by Kraftwerk and George Clinton, and was a cut above the primitive DR-55 drum machine he'd previously had. \"The 808 allowed you to actually build your own patterns – you were able to put the kick drums and snares where you wanted them. It opened up a lot of creativity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in New York, Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force had recorded their 1982 hip-hop track Planet Rock, giving the nascent style a bright shaft of daylight between it and the funk that had come before. Greg Broussard, a producer in Los Angeles calling himself The Egyptian Lover, found out that it was the 808 that gave the track its distinct character and went to play with it at a local music store. \"I programmed the Planet Rock beat and fell in love with this machine,\" he remembers dewily. \"It blew me away. Everything sounded a bit toy-like, but at the same time it made you want to dance. I bought it right there on the spot.\" After a self-taught crash course, he played it live the next day in front of 10,000 people in a sports arena with his Uncle Jamm's Army DJ crew. \"I didn't have any other instruments – the beat was moving the whole crowd. Thousands of people were dancing to this one little drum machine.\" Over in Detroit, Atkins was also feeding it into his sideline as a DJ. \"We just took an 808 to the party, and made rhythm tracks on the fly – the place went crazy. It was something fresh, more than just playing a record.\"\n\nIt struck a chord as an instrument that truly reflected the 80s. \"Home computers were coming on the scene, and it just fitted in with that,\" says Joe Mansfield, a drum machine collector who wrote this year's pictorial history Beat Box: A Drum Machine Obsession. \"It sounded futuristic, what you thought a computer would sound like if it could play the drums.\" It began to seep into the mainstream, as the backbeat to Marvin Gaye's Sexual Healing, and across the Atlantic to the UK into, firstly, the industrial and post-punk scenes, where Graham Massey of Manchester acid house act 808 State first encountered it.\n\n\"It had that industrial heritage, but had that soul heritage,\" he says. \"The Roland gear began to be a kind of Esperanto in music. The whole world began to be less separated through this technology, and there was a classiness to it – you could transcend your provincial music with this equipment.\" Massey made hip-hop with the 808, and then, because he couldn't afford anything else, used it for house too, making \"dense, jungle-like\" tracks that also deployed the 909. \"On the 909 the kick was a bit more in your chest, a bit more of an aggressive drum machine. The 808 almost seems feminine next to it … the cowbell on the 808, that's the thing that says mid-80s R&B to me – SOS Band, big dancefloor anthems, which were a massive thing in the north-west of England. It wasn't just nerdy DJ culture, it was a 'ladies' night' kind of music.\"\n\nThe sounds became so much a part of dance music – where very often drums still don't sound like drums – that it's continued to endure, helped along by the digital versions made for production software. \"Producers are searching through kits of tens of thousands of drum sounds and always coming back to the 808,\" says Mansfield. \"It's embedded, it's constant.\" Hip-hop has continued to use it, with producers such as Lex Luger building intimidating 808 minimalism, and the juke artists of Chicago tapping its basic palette for their frenetically paced dance workouts.\n\nThese were heard by dubstep producer Tony Williams, inspiring his current Addison Groove project, which is based around the 808. \"If you layer its bass drum, clap and snare on top of each other, it fills up such a specific but perfect frequency range that it sounds great in a club, at home, even on laptop speakers,\" he says. Previously using a software version, he bought an actual 808 instead of buying a new car when superclub Fabric asked him to play a live set with one. \"I shouldn't really say this, but they've made it really easy to play live when you're drunk,\" he says in a languorous Bristolian drawl. \"The sound palette is one of the best that's ever existed – whatever you do is probably going to make people dance. And I really enjoy that, because I like a drink.\"\n\nThe new incarnations are designed to continue this live heritage, as more producers gravitate from laptops towards the improvisatory potential of hardware. They're unlikely to entirely replace the original, though, with their pungent whiff of madeleine; Broussard, AKA, The Egyptian Lover, has now hoarded six 808s, and his voice turns soft and fond when he talks about them. \"These machines are like my children – I could never get rid of them.\"", source: "", picture_url: "http://res.cloudinary.com/dzpkgj9f0/image/upload/v1467957997/igjrym7ciumdnovirfuf.jpg"}
